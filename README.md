This repo does nothing useful. These are just first experiments with both `otto` and `golang`.

TODO: 

* Next step, use Negroni to add some middleware like logging
* serve some static templates
* serve some static assets (css)
* create some models
* expose via api
* persist models to mongo w/ mgo
* contemplate partial model updates & partial views
